# ParkShare

Community Parking & Traffic Routing System

ParkShare is a web-based application that helps solve urban parking problems by connecting drivers with hosts (property owners) who have available parking spaces.
It also considers traffic conditions to suggest nearby private parking when public parking is congested.

This project is built as part of an academic project using Python (Flask) and SQLite.
